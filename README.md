# Sorting Algorithm Visualiser

## TLDR
This project is a visual tool designed to help users understand and learn various sorting algorithms through interactive visualizations. It provides a clear and engaging interface where users can observe the sorting process of algorithms like Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort. Developed using Python and Pygame, the tool allows for real-time interaction and manipulation of sorting parameters, making it a useful educational resource.

## Overview

This project demonstrates sorting algorithms with real-time visualizations. Key features include:

- Interactive visualizations of sorting algorithms to help users grasp the concepts of sorting.
- Real-time updates of the sorting process, allowing users to see how different algorithms work step-by-step.
- User controls to start, reset, and switch between sorting algorithms and sorting orders (ascending/descending).

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for core functionality and logic
- **Pygame** for graphical user interface and real-time visualizations
- **Random** module for generating data for sorting visualizations

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/MantraayPatil/Algorithm-Visualizer>

2. Install Dependencies:
    Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages. Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Application:
    Execute the main script to start the visualiser:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python package:

- **pygame**

To install the required package, you can use the `requirements.txt` file included in the repository. If you don't have pip installed, you will need to install it first. 

## Usage

The Sorting Algorithm Visualiser provides several interactive features:

- **Start/Reset Button:**
  Click this button to start the sorting process or reset the visualisation if itâ€™s completed.

- **Sorting Algorithm Button:**
  Click this button to switch between different sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.

- **Ascending/Descending Button:**
  Use this button to toggle the sorting order between ascending and descending.

The visualiser will update in real-time, allowing you to see the sorting process step-by-step. Interact with the buttons to explore how different algorithms sort the list of numbers.
